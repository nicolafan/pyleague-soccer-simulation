## Features
* League setup with csv configuration.
* Possibility of changing the parameters of each team (_strength value_, _attack power_, _defense power_).
* Realistic outcome and score generation.
* Scores and outcomes slightly influenced by the form of the team.
* Updated standings screen.
* (In development) Realistic outgoing of the games played in a single matchday.

## Future developments
PyLeague can be seen as a basis for creating cool projects which need the generation of realistical random soccer results.
<br>Also, it can be improved and enhanced with many other features.
<br>The next developments of PyLeague will be:
* Enhancement and improvement of the available features.
* Improvement of code documentation.
* Development of the games simulation screen minute by minute.
* Tests creation.
* Many other possibilities!
